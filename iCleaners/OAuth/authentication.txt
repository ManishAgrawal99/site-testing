We may want an unauthenticated person to only perform a GET operation since we might not want an unauthenticated person to delete or edit the dishes or items we add

We might want the users to save certain dishes as their favourite dishes and only they can manipulate their own list of favourites

So we are wanting certain security in our websites

HTTP basic authentication

Method for HTTP user agent to provide username and password with a request
Server can challenge a client to authenticate itself

Client needs to send username and password in response

Server challenges the client by sending a reply with header type as WWW-authenticate:BASIC and a 401 header code

BASIC is the type of authentication

The client then sends in the username and password which is given by the word Basic and then the username and password is encoded in a base 64 encoded string

________________________________________________________

The authorization header consists of the following

Username and pass combined into a string
"username:password"
the resulting string literal is then encoded using Base64
The authorization method and a space ie Basic encodedString
