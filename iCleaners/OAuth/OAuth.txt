Roles of OAuth 2

Resource Owner
--------------
The Resource in this case is the identity of the user
The servers that we build wants to have access to these resources
These resources are present with the social media authentication service providers like FB Google and so on


If the profile info is stored with the FB for example, then our server may want to access these info and verify if that is really the user trying to access the express server


Client Application
------------------
So, our server here acts as the client application
These authentication service providers may not want to provide access to any random server
It may want to provide these to only an authenticated server
So, our server must register itself with the FB with an account sayin that it is operating an app and it wants to register itself as a potential source which can approach FB to authenticate users

After registering, it will receive a ClientID and a Client Secret from FB
To do this, we must have an authenticated account on FB

So, in order to get the resources, we must connect to the FB OAuth 2 authentication server and the server that gives access to the profile info of the user

Authorization server
--------------------
It is the server that authorizes somebody to access the resource server in order to retrieve the profile info

Now, the user must authorize the express server, to go to the resource server to fetch the profile info.
But, if the user needs to authorize the express server, the user needs to login to the FB account and then obtain info from FB called as an access token which the user will pass onto the express server

When the token is received from FB OAuth 2, it is issued on terms of llowing the clien application or the Express server which is already registered on FB to access their profile info from their FB Oauth service provider

Now, for the user to access a token, it has to login into the FB stating that it needs to login to authenticate this express server.
For this, it sends a Client ID of the express server embedded in it

The Client secret that it gains is not revealed to anybody.
It will be only in the express server side
But when the express server tries to authenticate to access the user's profile from FB, the express server will send, both the client ID and the client secret along with the access token that the user supplies the express server to FB

In turn, the FB authorizes the client server to access the users profile 

Now, the express serever wil create an account for this particular user who has logged in from FB and then subsequently supply a JWT which the user can then use to access the data in the express server

In addition to these, there is also a refresh token.
When an access token is issued by the FB OAuth 2 server, access token has a limited lifetime. After that the access token will become invalid.
So, this token needs to be made confidential
So, al these exchanges of tokens b/w different sites will be done in an encrypted meethod using HTTPS protocol.

So, when sending the access token from user to Express server, it must be done in an HTTPS manner.

If anybody gets access to the access token can act as that user

These refresh tokens are used to refresh an expired access token

Registering on the OAuth server

We also need to register a redirect URL while registering the client application
