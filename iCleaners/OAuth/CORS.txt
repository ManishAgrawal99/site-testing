Middleware  to include for these

npm install cors --save

CORS NodeModule
It allows to configure CORS on the server side including specifying credentials origin info where the credentials would be accepted
__________________________________
Need for it
______________________
Many applications pull data from many different websites to construct a webpage
In order to impose a strict policy of access to resources from different websites, The same origin policy has been accepted

The JS codes we have may have to access resources from different sites and this is where CORS problem comes up

_________________________

The Same Origin Policy declares how the data loaded from one origin will interact with resources from another origin
The purpose is to prevent malicious interactions of code
___________________________

What is same origin

It is defined by three tuples
-protocol, host name, port number

The data resource can be anything from a web page, image and json

____________________________

Cross Origin Requests

Accessing a resource from a different domain, protocol or port

How to solve the issue

Browsers restrict the cross origin request initiated from within scripts.
eg. XMLHttpRequest or Fetch

______________________________

Cross Origin  Resource Sharing

Mechanism to give web servers cross domain access controls

Browser and server interact to determine whether it is safe or not and if the access to the resource is an acceptable situation

A new set of HTTP headers were included into the HTTP reply messages coming from the server side
These headers give a set of resources that are permitted by the server to access the browser

The browser then realizes that the access to that resources are permittable even though they are not allowed

So, we have headers like
Access Control Allow Origin,
Access Control Allow Credentials,
Access Control Allow Headers,
Access Control Allow Methods

that tells the browser that this is an acceptable state

____________________________

Types

Simple Cross Site Requests

Get/Post with req body containing application/x-www-form-urlencoded, multipart/form-data or text/plain

No custom header is allowed in this case


Preflighted Requests
Methods that can cause side effects on servers data
specially PUT and DELETE

Credentialed Requests
When we expect the clients to include credentials in the header
eg. requests accompanied by cookies
