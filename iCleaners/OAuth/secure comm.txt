Getting the private key and certificates

can refer to this
https://blog.didierstevens.com/2015/03/30/howto-make-your-own-cert-with-openssl-on-windows/

Get into the bin folder and then do the following in cmd

set RANDFILE=c:\demo\.rnd
set OPENSSL_CONF=C:\OpenSSL-Win32\bin\openssl.cfg

Now get into the openssl by
c:\OpenSSL-Win32\bin\openssl.exe

Creates a 1024 bit private key
genrsa -out private.key 1024

Genearate a certificate with the above private key
req -new -key private.key -out cert.csr


Create a distributable certificate by the extension .pem

 x509 -req -in cert.csr -signkey private.key -out certificate.pem

Installing the HTTPS module

var https = require('https');
var fs = require('fs');

var options = {
key: fs.readFileSync(__dirname+'/private.key'),
cert:fs.readFileSync(__dirname+'/certificate.pem')
};

var secureServer = https.createServer(options,app);


install openssl from https://wiki.openssl.org/index.php/Binaries

Encryption

Encryption is needed to prevent some other malicious user from posing itself as a genuine user.
The security aspect is needed to be made


Simple Cryptography
The message that is to be sent is encrypted by a key and the same key is needed to decrypt the encrypted message.
But passing the key can compromise the security.

Public key Cryptography
Here 2 keys are used.
Public & Private
Public key is distributed freely for others to send the message.
But only a private key is capable of decrypting the message.
But the process is costly, so we can make use of this to only make an understanding of the genuine user and then make use of the previous method



SSL & TSL
Secure Socket Layer & Transport Layer Security

These are cryptographic protocols that enable secure communication over an insecure network

Privacy & Integrity of communication is maintained on either the SSL or TLS by using a combination of public key cryptography together with symmetric key cryptography

We are doing these for 2 particular reasons:
To maintain the secure comm b/w the the seender and receiver so that no malicious user interferes
To maintain integrity to ensure the receiver that the message has not been tampered with


How they actually work
______________________
It is done through a handshaking process

-Client sends a message to the server specifying that the client wants to communicate with the server securely.
-At this point the server will send back a certificate to the client with a public key that has been certifited by the certification Authority belonging to server
-When the client receives these, it is able to verify the clients credential.
The client is established that is really talking to the server.
-Now that the credentials of the server is verified, the client now holds the public key
-The client now generates a pre master secret
This is used by the client and the server to generate the session key.
The client then encrypts the secret using the servers public key
-Once the secret is ncrypted using the public key, No one except the server will be able to extract the encrypted message.
-The server when receives the message, it extracts the pre-master secret from this message.
The client and the server both holds the same secret key, so they follow the same sets of steps starting with the pre master's secret and the same set of values that will generate a key called as the session key.
-No both client and server holds the same session key



HTTPS
------

It is a combination of HTTP and encryption decryption layer of SSL/TSL

In order for users to make connection with the servers they require a certification
It is provided by VeriSign & Thwate Corporation which are public certification authorities

These certification authorities then authenticate the credentials and then issue a public key and a private key for use on server side
The public key is certified by certification authority and from there on they carry a certificate

Here we are using SSL but it is not allowed outside
But when publishing the website we need to have one of the certifications from veriSign & thwate corporation & comodo
