For a full fledged REST API 

If we get a GET request, it means that we want to retrieve the data from the server and use it
So when a get request is issued, it is first processed by the EXPRESS and then it knows that it requires the database access operations

__________________________________________________________


Similarly a POST request coming in to the server carries a message in the body and the information is needed to be stored on the DB.
The info from the body is taken and a create request is made at the DB

_________________________________________________________

Hence, every HTTP request that we get is mapped on to a corresponding database operation

________________________________________________________

Here we take in conFusion server folder as it is and then add the models we created in the node-mongoose folder
After this we install some of the node modules
1.mongoose
2.bluebird
3.mongoose-currency

npm install mongoose bluebird mongoose-currency --save

mongoose-currency adds the support for currency data type

________________________________________________________

Now to manage the subdocuments inside the modules,
ie. the Comments
we can use the entire code used in the Routers and edit them to support
 /Comments and /Comments/CommentsId
