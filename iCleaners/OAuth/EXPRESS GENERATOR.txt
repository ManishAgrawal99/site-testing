It is a tool that gives us a startup application with some starting code already built and some standard middleware included into the application to reduce the work

_________________________________________________________
In order to use it
We need to install the express generator as a global NPM module from the command line
npm install express-generator -g

__________________________________________________________

Once we have installed the global API module 
we just need to type express <Name of application>

This will generate a folder with the name of application typed in
It can have a variety of options like 
different kinds of view generators like JADE EJS and more

After this we need to move into this folder and do the npm install for all for all the npm modules we added in the express application
npm install
npm install body-parser --save
